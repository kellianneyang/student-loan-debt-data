# 2020-2021 Average US Student Loan Debt by State

In this notebook, I use the matplotlib python library to create a choropleth map representing the Student Loan Debt by School 2020-2021 data set on data.world. The original visualization was used in the [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) series as ["Which Schools Create the Most Student Loans?"](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w24) on June 13, 2021.

Makeover Monday used the visualization from the article ["What Schools Create the Most Student Loans in the U.S.?"](https://howmuch.net/articles/university-with-the-most-student-loan-originations-in-every-state) published on [bloomberg.com](https://howmuch.net/) on March 9, 2021, and the original data is from the [U.S. Department of Education, Common Origination and Disbursement (COD)](https://cod.ed.gov/). 

The purpose of creating this graphic was to practice creating a choropleth map. I chose to alter the purpose of the graphic slightly. The original map shows the schools, one per state, in which the students had the highest loan debt. For my version, I showed the average loan debt across all schools for each state. 

The reader should be able to see the states with the highest and lowest average loan amounts. Washington, DC, was a major outlier, and the "state" with the highest average loan debt per student.
